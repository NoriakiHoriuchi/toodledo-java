toodledo-java
-------------

This is an _UNOFFICIAL_ implementation of the www.toodledo.com REST API in Java.
Coded by me (Marc) phlegias@gmail.com

Usage
-----
This is basically a library with a nice and helpfull (hopefully) API to work with Toodledo. Easily extensible and bla bla bla.

Libs
----
I use some libs, like the mytical httpclient-commons. I've not uploaded the jars in the repository, if you're using this you'll need to download them separately.
